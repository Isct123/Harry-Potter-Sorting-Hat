# Harry-Potter-Sorting-Hat
This was a school project, and it turned out really well. I'm pretty pleased

**Requirements:**
 1. Builtin Python modules such as Tkinter, OS, operator, json, etc.
 2. Third party python modules pyglet and pygame. In case your computer doesn't meet these requirements, you the program will automatically install the modules for you.

**External File Sources**
 1. All houses .mp3 files were recorded manually by me. I acquired them from a yt vid that I can't find rn.
 4. e.mp3 is the Harry Potter theme file. I got it from this website: https://www.zedge.net/find/ringtones/harry%20potter%20theme%20song
 5. I got the harry potter font from this site:https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiXheKOkqb6AhUHR2wGHWQ_DPEQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dafont.com%2Fharry-p.font&usg=AOvVaw0baShM6iMUGeq2_1IE04ss
 
 **Instructions**
 1. There are two versions to this program. One is terminal (boring) and the other is GUI (fun)
 2. To run the GUI program, just simply run the file. However, ensure that you have all the dependent external files installed on your system.
